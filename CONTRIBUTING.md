# Contributing to asciinema

First, if you're opening a Github issue make sure it goes to the correct repository:

* [asciinema/asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues) - command-line recorder
* [asciinema/asciinema.org](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server/issues) - public website hosting recordings
* [asciinema/asciinema-player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/issues) - player

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue in Github issue tracker.
Tell us what's the problem and include steps to reproduce it (reliably).
Including your OS/browser/terminal name and version in the report would be great.

## Submitting patches with bug fixes

If you found a bug and made a patch for it:

* make sure all tests pass
* send us a pull request, including a description of the fix (referencing an existing issue if there's one)

## Requesting new features

We welcome all ideas.
If you believe most asciinema users would benefit from implementing your idea then feel free to open a Github issue.
However, as this is an open-source project maintained by a small team of volunteers we simply can't implement all of them due to limited resources. Please keep that in mind.

## Proposing features/changes (pull requests)

If you want to propose code change, either introducing a new feature or improving an existing one, please first discuss this with asciinema team. You can simply open a separate issue for a discussion or join #asciinema IRC channel on Libera.Chat.

## Asking for help

Github issue tracker is not a support forum. If you need help then either [join
#asciinema IRC channel on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/gamja/#asciinema) or 
ask a question on [asciinema community forum](https://discourse.asciinema.org/).
